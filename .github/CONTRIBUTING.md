# Contribution Guidelines

## Commit messages

Please use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) (also known as semantic commits) to ensure consistent and descriptive commit messages when submitting PRs.

- `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.
- `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.
- `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
- `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..
- `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.
